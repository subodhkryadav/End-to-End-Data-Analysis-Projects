## 🛠️ The Power Trio: How I Work
I specialize in combining these three core technologies to deliver end-to-end solutions:

1.  **SQL**: Used for data extraction, cleaning, and complex transformations from relational databases.
2.  **Python**: Utilized for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), advanced statistics, and automating data workflows.
3.  **Power BI**: My go-to tool for data modeling, DAX, and creating high-impact visual dashboards for stakeholders.
