## 📂 What's Inside?
This directory contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) and Python scripts (`.py`) covering:
* **Data Cleaning & Wrangling:** Handling missing data, outliers, and data normalization.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Discovering patterns, trends, and relationships using statistical methods.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating impactful charts and graphs to tell a story with data.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables to improve data depth.

## 🛠️ Libraries & Tools
**Aap** will find projects utilizing the following Python ecosystem:
* **Data Manipulation:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`
* **Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`
* **Statistical Modeling:** `Scipy`, `Statsmodels`
* **Machine Learning:** `sklearn`
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Google Colab

## 🚀 Professional Workflow
In every project stored here, I focus on:
1. **Objective:** Defining the business problem.
2. **Data Processing:** Ensuring high data quality and integrity.
3. **Analysis:** Using Python to extract key performance indicators (KPIs).
4. **Insights:** Providing data-driven recommendations.
